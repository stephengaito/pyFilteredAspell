# pyFilteredAspell

A simple python command line wrapper to provide configurable pre-filters 
to the [aspell command line tool](http://aspell.net/).

This python3 script wraps the linux aspell command line command with a 
configurable set of pre-filters. 

The pyFilteredAspell command manipulates the aspell optional arguments: 
`--mode`, `-D`, '-e', '-H', '-t', '-n', '-M'. These optional arguments are 
used to set the pyFilteredAspell command's `filterName` variable. All 
other aspell arguments are passed unchanged to aspell. 

The pre-filters use by the pyFilteredAspell command are located in the 
user's `.config/pyFilteredAspellFilters` directory. 

The filters are chosen using configuration YAML which is loaded from 
the `.config/pyFilteredAspellFilters/config.yaml` file.

This configuration YAML has three dictionaries, each a mapping from the 
filterName to some other (string) value: 

1. `mapFilter` : (re)maps the filterName to a new filterName. This allows 
you to map an arbitrary filterName into a name either aspell or 
pyFilteredAspell understands. 

2. `mapFilterModule` : maps the filterName to a loadable Python module in 
the `.config/pyFilteredAspellFilters` directory. This allows a single 
Python module to handle multiple filterNames. 

3. `useAspellFilter` : maps the filterName to a boolean which if True will 
ensure aspell's existing filter mode (with the name contained in the 
filterName variable) will be used directly. 

These mappings are applied in the order: `mapFilter`, `mapFilterModule`, 
`useAspellFilter` 

## Installation

Get and unpack a copy of this repository.

To install the command and associated filters type:

```
  cd pyFilteredAspell
  sh install
```

If you wish to use the `commieFilter.py` filter provided, you will also 
need to install the `commie` Python3 package: 

```
  pip install commie
```

## Adding new filters

You can add your own aspell pre-filters by adding Python3 modules to the 
`~/config/pyFilteredAspellFilters` directory. Any module you add *must* 
define a `run` function which takes one argument, the name of the filter 
that you want applied. (This is the final result of the `mapFilter` 
mapping defined above).

Your `run` function *must* extract and return the contents of the stdin 
which you want spell checked. If you are using pyFilteredAspell as part of 
the external spell checker for an editor, it is *useful* to change all 
non-whitespace that you do not want to spell check into spaces. (See the 
`commieFilter.py` for an example of how to do this).
